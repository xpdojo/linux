## SSH Client

The SSH client is a program for logging into a remote machine and for executing commands on a remote machine.  It is intended to provide secure encrypted communications between two untrusted hosts over an insecure network.  X11 connections, arbitrary TCP ports and UNIX-domain sockets can also be forwarded over the secure channel.
